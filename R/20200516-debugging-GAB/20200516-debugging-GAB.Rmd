How do you debug your R scripts? Maybe you insert print statements, or you break-down for loops into a non loop to run line-by-line. While these may help you successfully debug your code, they are not the most efficient. In R Studio, you could simply place "browser()" before a section of buggy code (or in a conditional statement). This will allow you to run the code line-by-line and observe environments/variables. See the code below and the following resource for more information: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205612627-Debugging-with-RStudio


```{r }
for (x in 1:4){
  if (x>2){browser()}
  print(x)
  browser()
  print(10*x)
}
```
