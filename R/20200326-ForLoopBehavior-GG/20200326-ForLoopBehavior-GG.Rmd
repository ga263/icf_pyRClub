```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r }

x <- c(5,2,7)
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  cat(i, x[i],"\n")
}

```
This produces the expected result:
1 5; 
2 2; 
3 7; 

But this does not work if the upper bound is zero:

```{r }

y <- x[x>10]
for (i in 1:length(y)) {
  cat(i, y[i], "\n")
}


```

which produces

1 NA;
0  ;

The problem is that the loop is done twice (with i=1 and i=0) when you dont want it done at all.  R has a rule that sequences automatically decrease if the second value is less than the first, so z <- 1:0 is a list of length two.

To get the correct behavior I usually just put the loop inside a test:


```{r }

y <- x[x>10]
if (length(y)>0) {
  for (i in 1:length(y)) {
    cat(i, y[i], "\n")
  }
}


```
Then it does nothing.
