```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Assume some computations generate probabilities below ..
```{r }
require(testit)

prob_A <- 0.1
prob_B <- 0.3
prob_C <- 0.4
prob_D <- 0.2
```

Asumming that the sum of probabilities should = 1, we can insert an assert statement to check that that condition is always satisfied
```{r }
assert("Sum of all probabilities should equal 1",
       {
       sum(prob_A, prob_B, prob_C, prob_D) == 1
       })
```
