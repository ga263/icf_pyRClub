    "My tip of the week is about generator expressions.  These look like list comprehensions without the brackets, but they act very differently behind the scenes and are very useful when working with lots of data!  Why?  A list comprehension will create an entire new object in memory, which can take up quite a bit of space and even slow your code.  A generator expression, however, only \"generates\" each item on the fly, saving you potentially quite a bit of memory!  For example, say you have a very long list of numeric strings, and you want to convert them to numbers and sum them.  You might be tempted to say:"
